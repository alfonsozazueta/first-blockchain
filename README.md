# first-blockchain
This project implements a simple cryptocurrency and blockchain system using Python. It includes functionality for mining new blocks, validating the blockchain, adding transactions, and decentralizing the blockchain network by connecting multiple nodes.

This is following the proof of Work consensus protocol, the one Bitcoin uses
**Features**
Blockchain: Core class for managing the chain of blocks.
Transactions: Enables adding and tracking cryptocurrency transactions.
Proof of Work: Implements mining logic.
Validation: Ensures blockchain integrity.
Decentralization: Supports multiple nodes with synchronization of the chain.
API Endpoints: Allows interaction with the blockchain using HTTP requests.
