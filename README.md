# first-blockchain
This project implements a simple cryptocurrency and blockchain system using Python. It includes functionality for mining new blocks, validating the blockchain, adding transactions, and decentralizing the blockchain network by connecting multiple nodes.

**Requirements**
Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:

Flask (v0.12.2): A lightweight WSGI web application framework.

pip install Flask==0.12.2
Postman: A tool for testing APIs (Download here).
Requests (v2.18.4): A library for making HTTP requests.

pip install requests==2.18.4

**Features**
Blockchain: Core class for managing the chain of blocks.
Transactions: Enables adding and tracking cryptocurrency transactions.
Proof of Work: Implements mining logic.
Validation: Ensures blockchain integrity.
Decentralization: Supports multiple nodes with synchronization of the chain.
API Endpoints: Allows interaction with the blockchain using HTTP requests.
